# parse.cefconnect

Author is in NO WAY associated with CEFConnect.

Some qwik-n-dirty code to help a mate retrieve closed end fund data from CEFConnect (currently EoMonth, can be swapped to Weekly easily by changing the 5Y to 10Y and then parsing all the records etc), saves all results into a local csv file.

Accesses the API at http://www.cefconnect.com/fund/AWP?view=fund for example, to pluck data for further analysis.
